This example shows how to add authentication to your Lambda functions using the
open source [Ory Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos) project.

## Demo

## How to Use

You can choose from one of the following two methods to use this repository:

### One-Click Deploy

Deploy the example using
[Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme):

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/edge-functions/auth-with-ory&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API,CLERK_API_KEY,CLERK_JWT_KEY&project-name=clerk-authentication&repo-name=clerk-authentication)

### Clone and Deploy

Execute
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)
with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/ory/kratos-nextjs-react-example auth-with-ory
# or
yarn create next-app --example https://github.com/ory/kratos-nextjs-react-example auth-with-ory
```

Per default this example will use the Ory Kratos public playground. You can
either run Ory Kratos in Ory Cloud or deploy Ory Kratos locally. Regardless of
what you choose, set the `ORY_SDK_URL` environment variable to your Ory Cloud or
Ory Kratos URL and start the app:

```shell
# If deployed on Ory Cloud:
# export ORY_SDK_URL=https://<your-project-slug>.projects.oryapis.com/
export ORY_SDK_URL=https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/
npm run dev
```
